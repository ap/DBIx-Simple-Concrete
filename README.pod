=head1 NAME

DBIx::Simple::Concrete - monkey-patch DBIx::Simple to use SQL::Concrete

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use DBIx::Simple::Concrete;
 # ...
 my $rows = $db->cquery( '
     SELECT title
     FROM threads
     WHERE date >', \$date, '
     AND', { subject => \@subjects }, '
 ' )->arrays;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The recommended way to use L<SQL::Concrete> is via its L<DBIx::Simple>
integration, which provides an excellent alternative to plain DBI access.

But by loading this module instead (or after) L<DBIx::Simple>, a C<cquery>
method will be added to it which integrates L<SQL::Concrete> just the same
way as its built-in C<iquery> method integrates L<SQL::Interp>.

This is all there is to this module.
